README for xsane for win32:


This is an early Version of xsane for win32.
It may have several bugs. It is not tested very well
but short tests looked very good.

This version supports:
 - preview scan, preview zoom
 - scan and save to pnm, ps and raw file, if compiled in also jpeg, png and tiff
 - handling of all backend options
 - helpfiles
 - copy mode (printing via ghostscript, see section "copy mode")
 - gimp-plugin


It does not support:
 - fax mode (no compatible faxsoftware)
 - internationalization not setup correct


Installation:
=============
 - unpack the archiv to c:\
   that creates the directory c:\Sane with several files
   you do not need to copy any files, simply call xsane or scanimage
 
 - Sane MUST BE installed in c:\sane because the paths are hardcoded.
   Xsane will not work correct if you install it at any other place!

 - make sure you have a directory c:\temp (or whatever you
   define as temporary directory in xsane's setup)

 - there are two icons (xsane-32x32.ico and xsane-48x48.ico)
   that you can use if you set a link from xsane.exe to your desktop,
   for that use right mouse button and change properties of the link,
   change icon and select "c:\sane\xsane-??x??.ico"


Configuration:
==============
 edit c:\Sane\etc\sane.d\net.conf
 and enter a list of NetBEUI names or of IP-addresses
 of machines you want to connect to. On some Windows
 system IP-addresses are not accepted; if you experience
 any problems try the NetBUI names.

example for net.conf:
myhost1
myhost2.mydomain.com
192.168.0.1
192.169.1.73

 you also can start xsane with host:backend:device given as command line option:
 	xsane 192.168.0.1:umax:/dev/scanner
or
	xsane myhost:umax:/dev/scanner


Copy-Mode:
===========
If you want to use copy mode, you need ghostscript for win32.
You can download it e.g. from http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~ghost/
Enter Setup/Copy options:
enter as Command:
	c:/gs/gs6.50/bin/gswin32c -sDEVICE=mswinpr2 -dNOPAUSE -
Pay attention: you have to use "/", don´t use "\".
With sDEVICE=mswinpr2 you select the Printer Dialog of Windows.

You also can enter DEVICE-name of your printer (e.g. laserjet).
To get a list of available device names open a dos box,
and call c:\gs\gs6.50\bin\gswin32c -h


Gimp-Plugin:
===========
If you want to use xsane as gimp plugin,
copy xsane.exe and *.dll to the GIMP´s plug-ins driectory
(e.g. c:\Program Files\GIMP\plug-ins)


Support:
========
 There is no special support for xsane for win32.
 I develop xsane on a linux machine and will make a binary version
 for win32 from time to time.

Contact:
========
 You can contact me via email: Oliver.Rauch@rauch-domain.de
 but don`t ask for help/support for xsane-win32, I do not have the
 time to give support to it and want to use my free time to
 work on the code - please understand that.
