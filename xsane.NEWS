  Due to changes in the configuration file routines
  you have to enter some data in preferences->setup.

  In general there is nothing special you have to care
  about to get xsane to work.
  Read xsane.CHANGES if you are interested in details of
  what has changed.

  If you experience any problems after you upgraded xsane 
  it may help to remove the setup and preferences files
  of xsane:

  rm -rf ~/.sane/xsane
