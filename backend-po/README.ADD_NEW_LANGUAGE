How to create a new backend translation:
----------------------------------------
If you want to add a new translation, newbackend.po.in or newbackend.po could
be a good start!

If you have translations to other languages or for other backends,
please send them to the backend author and to me <Oliver.Rauch@rauch-domain.de>

Thanks
Oliver

PS: The backend translation tables shall be included into the sane package,
    it will be in this directory only temporary.
