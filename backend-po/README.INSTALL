How to install a new backend translation:
-----------------------------------------
You must copy the sane-*.mo files to the position where the xsane.mo files are
placed.  This can be e.g. /usr/local/share/locale/de/LC_MESSAGES for the german
translations

e.g.:
cp de/sane-umax.mo /usr/local/share/locale/de/LC_MESSAGES
