You must copy the *.mo files to the position where the xsane.mo files are placed.
This can be e.g. /usr/local/share/locale/de/LC_MESSAGES for the german translations

e.g.:
cp de/umax.mo /usr/local/share/locale/de/LC_MESSAGES

If you want to add a new translation, newbackend.po could be a good start!

If you have translations to other languages or for other backends,
please send them to the backend author and to me <Oliver.Rauch@Wolfsburg.DE>

Thanks
