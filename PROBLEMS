 If you get segmentation faults or unexpected problems,
 try the following:

 - If you have NativeLanguageSupport (NLS)/gettext installed,
   make sure environment variable LANG is not set, xsane
   does not support NLS!

 - If you compiled  xsane/gtk/glib with the egcs compiler try
   recompiling all with the "normal" gcc compiler!
