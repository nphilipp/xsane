This is a list of what I want to change/include for xsane.
If you have any suggestions: mail to Oliver.Rauch@rauch-domain.de

Sign explaination:
 # planned for XSane-1.0.0
 + planned to do this soon/higher priority (but not promised for XSane-1.0)
 - comes later/lower priority

 batch scan:
 - load default list

 scan-function:
    # allow additional image data after each row (is sane standard conform)

 save-function:
    - list of last used filenames
    - save several images into one file for:
      - postscript
      - may be tiff
    ? enable filters in save mode?

 fax-function:
    # use internal viewer to display images
      # while scanning save image as pnm
      # convtert all images to one postscript file when sending fax
    + create lock file, add information while spooling fax
    + add coverpage with edit like mail function
    - add send delayed option
    - add options for sender/receiver Name
    + zoom ?
    # cleanup user interface of fax function

 email-function:
    # use internal viewer to display images
      # while scanning save image as pnm
      # convtert image to target format when sending email
      # add new image types to email fileformat: tiff, jpeg
    # cleanup user interface of email function

 gamma function:
    # add target gamma (e.g. for web publishing)
    # correct gtk custom gamma functions and include it
      may be write an own gamma curve widget

 medium selection:
    - medium definition in dependance of the scanner (?)
      (I am not sure if this makes sense with color managemant)

 preview function:
    # allow additional image data after each row (is sane standard conform)
    - force size of scanarea in pixels (calculate resolution)
      this will not produce exact results with some scanners!!!

 viewer function:
    # add more filters (sharpen?)
      suggestions? - ONLY REALLY IMPORTANT FILTERS,
      FOR OTHER IMAGE MANIPULATION THERE IS THE GIMP
    # crop
    # what about automatic increase of filename counter???
      this is not simple because there may be several
      viewers opend at the same time and a file in the
      viewer may be saved several times

 internal:
    + add color management - may be via xcmsdb or scarse (www.scarse.org)
      (not until xsane-1.0 I think)
    - average of a multiple scan of the same image
    + add range check / valid value when reading xsane.rc/*.drc files
    + add several defaults (fax=> mode=gray,...)
    - include much more parameters when saving images
    + test memory after each call of malloc - partly done
    - more/better online helpfiles (mostly done)
    - add infrared filter for transmissive rgbi scans:
      use next neighbour with high transmission(i) value
      (may be to viewer)
   + test if file is writable before scan is started
   ? show histogram of scanned image?
   ? show scanned image in save mode or automatically save image in viewer mode?
   ? project save/load with preview image, scanmode, .... ???


 include special functions for GNOME/KDE
   *** DOES ANYONE HAVE ANY SUGGESTIONS TO THIS ? ***
   - GNOME:
     - gnome-print support?
     - session management ?
   - drag and drop for preview image?
   - other drag and drop functions?

 TWAIN:
    - add a twain-win32 interface (for xsane-win32)
    - define a twain-unix interface in cooperation with TWAIN-group
      (first contact to TWAIN in summer 1999, TWAIN is intersted in
      creating a TWAIN-unix interface that uses sane as scanner driver API
    - add a twain-unix interface to xsane
 
 WIN32 version of xsane/sane
    - may be xsane-win32 without cygwin.dll on native win32 mode
    - may be later we make a sane-WIN32 version so that the backends do work too
