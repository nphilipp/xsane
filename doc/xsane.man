.SH DESCRIPTION
.B xsane
provides a graphical user-interface to control an image
acquisition device such as a flatbed scanner.  It allows
previewing and scanning invidual images and can be invoked either
directly from the command-line or through The GIMP image manipulation
program.  In the former case,
.B xsane
acts as a stand-alone program that saves acquired images in a suitable
PNM format (PBM for black-and-white images, PGM for grayscale images,
and PPM for color images) or converts the image to JPEG, PNG, PS or TIFF.
In the latter case, the images are directly passed to The GIMP for further
processing.

.B xsane
accesses image acquisition devices through the SANE (Scanner Access
Now Easy) interface.  The list of available devices depends on
installed hardware and configuration.  When invoked without an
explicit devicename argument,
.B xsane
presents a dialog listing all known and available devices.  To access
an available device that is not known to the system, the devicename
must be specified explicitly.
.SH RUNNING UNDER THE GIMP
To run
.B xsane
under the
.BR gimp (1),
simply set a symbolic link from the xsane-binary to one of the
.BR gimp (1)
plug-ins directories.  For example, the command
.PP
.RS
ln -s @BINDIR@/xsane ~/.gimp/plug-ins/
.RE
.PP
adds a symlink for the
.B xsane
binary to the user's plug-ins directory.  After creating this symlink,
.B xsane
will be queried by
.BR gimp (1)
the next time it's invoked.  From then on,
.B xsane
can be invoked through "Xtns->XSane->Device dialog..." menu entry.

You'll also find that the "Xtns->XSane" menu contains short-cuts
to the SANE devices that were available at the time the
.B xsane
was queried. 
Note that
.BR gimp (1)
caches these short-cuts in ~/.gimp/pluginrc.  Thus, when the list of
available devices changes (e.g., a new scanner is installed or the
device of the scanner has changed), then it is typically desirable
to rebuild this cache.  To do this, you can either
.BR touch (1)
the
.B xsane
binary (e.g., "touch @BINDIR@/xsane") or delete the plugin cache
(e.g., "rm ~/.gimp/pluginrc").  Either way, invoking
.BR gimp (1)
afterwards will cause the pluginrc to be rebuilt.
.SH OPTIONS
.PP
If the
.B --version
or
.B -v
flag is given xsane prints a version information and exits.
.PP
The
.B --scan
or
.B -s
flag forces xsane to start in scan mode.
.PP
The
.B --fax
or
.B -f
flag forces xsane to start in fax mode.
.PP
The
.B --copy
or
.B -c
flag forces xsane to start in fax mode.
.PP
The
.B --no-mode-selection
or
.B -n
flag disables the menu for xsane mode selection (scan, copy, fax).
.PP
The
.B --device-settings
or
.B -d
flag reads the next option as default filename
for device settings. The extension ".drc" must not
be included.
.PP
If the
.B --Fixed
or
.B -F
flag is given then xsane uses a fixed, non resizable main window.
The flag overwrites the preferences value.
.PP
If the
.B --Scrolled
or
.B -S
flag is given then xsane uses a scrolled, resizable main window.
The flag overwrites the preferences value.
.PP
The
.B --display
flag selects the X11 display used to present the graphical user-interface
(see
.BR X (1)
for details).
.PP
The
.B --no-xshm
flag requests not to use shared memory images.  Shared memory images
usually enhance performance but cause problems with some buggy X11
servers.  Unless your X11 server dies when running this program, there
is no need or advantage to specify this flag.
.PP
The
.B --sync
flag requests a synchronous connection with the X11 server.  This is for
debugging purposes only.
.SH FILES
.TP
.I $HOME/.sane/xsane/xsane.rc
This files holds the user preferences.  Normally, this file should not
be manipulated directly.  Instead, the user should customize the
program through the "Preferences" menu.
.TP
.I $HOME/.sane/xsane/devicename.rc
For each device, there is one rc-file that holds the saved settings
for that particular device.  Normally, this file should not be
manipulated directly.  Instead, the user should use the
.B xsane
interface to select appropriate values and then save the device
settings using the "Preferences->Save Device Settings" menubar entry.
.TP
.I $HOME/.sane/preview-devicename.ppm
After acquiring a preview,
.B xsane
normally saves the preview image in this device-specific file.  Thus,
next time the program is started up, the program can present the old
preview image.  This feature can be turned off through the
"Preferences->Preview Options..." dialog.
.TP
.I @DATADIR@/sane-style.rc
This system-wide file controls the aspects of the user-interface such
as colors and fonts.  It is a GTK style file and provides fine control
over the visual aspects of the user-interface.
.TP
.I $HOME/.sane/sane-style.rc
This file serves the same purpose as the system-wide style file.  If
present, it takes precedence over the system wide style file.
