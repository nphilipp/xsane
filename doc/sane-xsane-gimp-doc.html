<blockquote>&nbsp;
<p>To start xsane as a gimp plugin, you have to set a symbolic link from
the xsane binary to a GIMP plug-ins directory. If xsane is located in /usr/local/bin&nbsp;
and you use-gimp-1.0.x do:
<blockquote>
<pre>ln -s /usr/local/bin/xsane ~/.gimp/plug-ins/</pre>
</blockquote>
if you use gimp-1.1.x, you have to do:
<blockquote>
<pre>ln -s /usr/local/bin/xsane ~/.gimp-1.1/plug-ins/</pre>
</blockquote>
You can start xsane from the GIMP menu <i>Xtns/Xsane </i>if GIMP-version
&lt; 1.1.9, since GIMP-version-1.1.9 you can start xsane from the GIMP
menu<i> File/Acquire.</i> It contains short-cuts to the SANE devices that
were available at the time xsane was queried.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Note that gimp(1) caches these short-cuts in ~/.gimp/pluginrc.
Thus, when the list of&nbsp; available devices changes (e.g., a new scanner
is installed or the device of the scanner has changed),&nbsp; then it is
typically desirable to rebuild this cache. To do this, you can either&nbsp;
touch(1) the xsane binary (e.g.,"touch&nbsp; /usr/local/bin/xsane") or
delete the plugin cache (e.g.,&nbsp; "rm&nbsp; ~/.gimp/pluginrc"). Either
way, invoking gimp(1) afterwards will cause the pluginrc to be rebuilt.
<p>If xsane is started as GIMP plugin it always sends the scanned image
to the GIMP, copy- or fax- mode can not selected when xsane runs as GIMP
plugin!</blockquote>
