- Enter xsane-0.xx directory. 
- To compile call ./configure and make. 
- To install call make install as root. 
- Call xsane. 
- If you get an error message  that libsane-dll.so.1 is not found, you have to
  tell your system where the SANE-libraries are installed.
    For linux: edit /etc/ld.so.conf and add a line with the path to the
    libraries (normally /usr/local/lib/sane), then call ldconfig as root.
