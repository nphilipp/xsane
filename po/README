SHORT DESCRIPTION:
------------------

XSane uses gettext for supporting translation into different languages. 

- To remake the *.po files when the original texts have changed or new texts have been added:
  make update-po
- To create the translation tables:
  make
- Using "u" (untranslated) and "f" (fuzzy) in emacs po-mode for updating strings.
- if you use other editors, search for keyword "fuzzy" and for \"\"
- when you translated fuzzy fields, remove the "fuzzy" marker, otherwise the
  translation will NOT be used
- The po files have to be in UTF-8 code!
- to recode non-UTF-8 po files to UTF-8 put the po file
  into the IMPORT_PO_DIR directory and call in the po directory
  "make import-po-files"


SELECT YOUR LANGUAGE:
---------------------

set environment variable LANG to your language
(eg. export LANG=german) and call xsane
You have to set the correct keyword. When you select
LANG=fr you will select the french translated texts but
not the correct fonts. Setting LANG=french works fine.

Note that some texts are stored in the preferences file
	~/.sane/xsane/xsane.rc
When you select another language you may want to remove
this file to also get these texts translated.

Note that backend dependant texts may not be translated because
there is possibly no translation table for selected language
for the backend you use.


NEW TRANSLATIONS:
-----------------

To create a new translation for a new language
copy xsane.pot to "language".po and edit "language".po

Create the new translation table in UTF-8 code if possible.
The po files have to be in UTF-8 code for many systems!

The field TEXT_TRANSLATION_INFO is meant for you to enter
your Name and Email-Adress, e.g.:
 "English translation\n"
 "by your name\n"
 "Email: your.email@address.domain\n"

Note that it is NOT allowed to translate the menu paths of the gimp!

To test/install your new translation:
 - edit xsane-0.*/configure, search for ALL_LINGUAS and add "language"
 - enter xsane-0.*, do
 - make distclean
 - ./configure
 - make
 - make install

If you want to make your translation public
please send your "language".po file to:
Oliver Rauch <Oliver.Rauch@rauch-domain.de>
