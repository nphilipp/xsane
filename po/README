SHORT DESCRIPTION:
------------------

XSane uses gettext for supporting translation into different languages. 

- To remake the *.po files when the original texts have changed or new texts have been added:
  make update-po
- To create the translation tables:
  make
- Using "u" (untranslated) and "f" (fuzzy) in emacs po-mode for updating strings.
- if you use other editors, search for keyword "fuzzy" and for \"\"
- when you translated fuzzy fields, remove the "fuzzy" marker


SELECT YOUR LANGUAGE:
---------------------

set environment variable LANG to your language
(eg. export LANG=german) and call xsane
You have to set the correct keyword. When you select
LANG=fr you will select the french translated texts but
not the correct fonts. Setting LANG=french works fine.



NEW TRANSLATIONS:
-----------------

To create a new translation for a new language
copy xsane.pot to "language".po and edit "language".po

The field TEXT_TRANSLATION_INFO is meant for you to enter
your Name and Email-Adress, e.g.:
 "English translation\n"
 "by your name\n"
 "Email: your.email@address.domain\n"

To test/install your new translation:
 - edit xsane-0.*/configure, search for ALL_LINGUAS and add "language"
 - enter xsane-0.*, do
 - make distclean
 - ./configure
 - make
 - make install

If you want to make your translation public
please send your "language".po file to:
Oliver Rauch <Oliver.Rauch@rauch-domain.de>
