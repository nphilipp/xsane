   The exception is that, if you link a SANE library with other files

   resulting executable to be covered by the GNU General Public
   License.  Your use of that executable is in no way restricted on
   account of linking the SANE library code into it.

   This exception does not, however, invalidate any other reasons why

   a subsequent release, you agree by submitting the changes that
   those changes may be distributed with this exception intact.

   If you write modifications of your own for SANE, it is your choice
   whether to permit this exception to apply to your modifications.
   If you do not wish that, delete this exception notice.

   This file implements a routine to restore option values saved to a
   file (using sanei_save_values()).  This is a bit tricky since
   setting an option may change the availability of other options.
   The problem is that we don't know the order of the set-value calls
   that resulted in the saved set of option values.  One solution
   might be to simply keep setting all option values until we no
   longer get any changes to the option value set.  However, that has
   the potential for live-lock.  Instead, we keep track of what
   options caused a SANE_INFO_RELOAD_OPTIONS.  For such options, their
   value is set exactly once.  This guarantees convergence after a
   bounded (and usually small) number of iterations.  The resulting
   value set is guaranteed to be the desired (saved) one as long as
   setting an option that affects availability of other options does
   not "lose" its value by setting another option.  I don't think any
   sane backend would do this and since this is SANE, we just proved
   that this algorithm works perfectly.  */
