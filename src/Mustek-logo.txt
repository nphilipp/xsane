Hi:
I discuss with the manager again and he agrees that the order of
logos is not important.
You can use the logo you provided and forget my previous mail.

  Hi:
  The manager of product design department prefers to reverse the order
  or SANE logo and Mustek logo.
  That is, to put the Mustek logo on the left side of SANE logo.
  How do you think about this suggestion?

  Tom
