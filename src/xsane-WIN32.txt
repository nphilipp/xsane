README for xsane for win32:


This is a win32 of xsane. It may have some bugs.

This version supports:
 - preview scan, preview zoom
 - scan and save to pnm, ps and raw file, if compiled in also jpeg, png and tiff
 - handling of all backend options
 - helpfiles
 - copy mode (printing via ghostscript, see section "copy mode")
 - gimp-plugin


It does not support:
 - fax mode (no compatible faxsoftware)


Installation:
=============
 - unpack the archiv to c:\
   that creates the directory c:\Sane with several files
   you do not need to copy any files, simply call xsane or scanimage
 
 - Sane MUST BE installed in c:\sane because the paths are hardcoded.
   Xsane will not work correct if you install it at any other place!

 - make sure you have a directory c:\temp (or whatever you
   define as temporary directory in xsane's setup)

 - there are two icons (xsane-32x32.ico and xsane-48x48.ico)
   that you can use if you set a link from xsane.exe to your desktop,
   for that use right mouse button and change properties of the link,
   change icon and select "c:\sane\xsane-??x??.ico"


Configuration:
==============
 edit c:\Sane\etc\sane.d\net.conf
 and enter a list of NetBEUI names or of IP-addresses
 of machines you want to connect to. On some Windows
 system IP-addresses are not accepted; if you experience
 any problems try the NetBUI names.

  example for net.conf:
    myhost1
    myhost2.mydomain.com
    192.168.0.1
    192.169.1.73

 you also can start xsane with host:backend:device given as command line option:
 	xsane 192.168.0.1:umax:/dev/scanner
 or
	xsane myhost:umax:/dev/scanner


Localisation:
=============
 You have to set the environment variable LANG to the language
 you want to select, for e.g. german this looks like this:
  set LANG=de
  xsane


Copy-Mode:
===========
 If you want to use copy mode, you need ghostscript for win32.
 You can download it e.g. from http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~ghost/
 Enter Setup/Copy options:
 enter as Command:
	c:/gs/gs6.50/bin/gswin32c -sDEVICE=mswinpr2 -dNOPAUSE -
 Pay attention: you have to use "/", don´t use "\".
 With sDEVICE=mswinpr2 you select the Printer Dialog of Windows.

 You also can enter DEVICE-name of your printer (e.g. laserjet).
 To get a list of available device names open a dos box,
 and call c:\gs\gs6.50\bin\gswin32c -h


Gimp-Plugin:
===========
 If you want to use xsane as gimp plugin,
 copy xsane.exe and *.dll to the GIMP´s plug-ins driectory
 (e.g. c:\Program Files\GIMP\plug-ins)


Support:
========
 There is no special support for xsane for win32.
 I develop xsane on a linux machine and will make a binary version
 for win32 from time to time.

Contact:
========
 You can contact me via email: Oliver.Rauch@rauch-domain.de
 but don`t ask for help/support for xsane-win32, I do not have the
 time to give support to it, I want to use my free time to
